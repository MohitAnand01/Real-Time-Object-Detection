# About Project

 Used TensorFlow for machine learning tasks, OpenCV for computer vision
 tasks, and NumPy for numerical computations.
 Defined functions for contour detection, measurement, point reordering,
 and image stacking.
 Capture frames from the webcam, preprocess the image, detect contours,
 measure objects, and display the results in real-time.
 Utilize Canny-Edge detection and perfrom dilation and erosion later.
